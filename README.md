# HTN BE Developer Challenge 23

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Atharva Gangal!

I'm excited to present my app for the Hack the North Backend Challenge 2023!

## System in action

[Here is a video of the system in action!](https://youtu.be/9a08hQmkewA)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository in the directory of your choice on the command line with `git clone`
2. Run Docker using `docker-compose up` (make sure you have the Docker daemon running before this setup)
3. Open a shell in the py-rest container using `docker exec -it <container-name> sh`
4. Run `python setup.py`, which creates and initializes the database `hacker.db`
5. Optionally wait for a few minutes (it takes some time for the database to set up)
6. You are all set to make requests using any application you like!

## Architecture Overview and Design Decisions

The backend uses Flask and REST endpoints. Routes are specified with the route() decorator. The backend runs in a Docker container. These decisions were taken to increase development speed.

The code is modularized with functions being used to handle most operations. This allows for code to be reused. For example, the same function handles both getting all user data and getting specific user data based on parameters passed to it.

SQLite is used for the database for quick development speed, fast performance, and better library support for Python. Prepared statements (parameter substitions) and assertions are used to prevent bad inputs and SQL injection attacks. A separate setup.py file is used to initialize the database. This allows for 'preprocessing' of data which allows for faster use.

Now, the important bit - data organization! Data is organized into three tables: a `hackers` table which stores user information, a `skills` table which stores skills and a `hacker_skill_map` table which maps hackers to their skills. Having three separate tables like this means that hackers and skills do not have to be duplicated in a single table. The `hacker_skill_map` table allows for efficient storage and easy joins when bulk data is required. A separate `skills` table makes skill aggregation easier, and makes joining easier too, as there is no need to join the `hackers` table during skill aggregation. The `id` columns of the `hackers` and `skills` tables are primary keys; and the `hacker_id` and `skill_id` columns in the `hacker_skill_map` table are foreign keys corresponding to those primary keys. The `rating` column is added to the `hacker_skill_map` table for convenience. Depending on the system and requirements, it can also be a separate table. Thus, the design is simple, yet scalable. 

There is always a tradeoff when it comes to joins. The join operation will be expensive when all data about hackers, skills and rating is requested as you would be joining 3 different tables. The assumption is that this data will not all have to be returned often, and users will be more interested in pulling and updating specific information.

## Futher Improvements

I would have loved to include further improvements, but due to the time commitments this term, I was unable to do so. My commitments next term are not the same as this term, so I can easily go beyond what I have presented here if I get the opportunity to join the HTN team!

Below, I go into detail for some of the things I would have implemented and a little about how I would have implemented them:

| Feature | Implementation | 
| --- | --- |
| Registration for events | Fundamentally, events will have a similar structure to skills, with an `id` and a `name`. To implement event registration, I would have an `events` table and create another `hacker_event_map` table.  |
| Delete endpoints | There would need to be methods to delete candidates. This can be done using the `DELETE` REST API method and using SQL `DELETE` statements.|
| Team allocations | An important aspect of the hackathon would be forming teams. For this, I would create a `teams` table to store project names, team names, and project scores, and create a `team_id` column in the `hackers` table which would be a foreign key to the primary key `id` of the teams table. |
| Addition of QR code identifiers | Each hacker can be given a QR code that contains a hashed value generated by some combination of their name, email and phone number so that it is unique to the individual. The `hackers` table can also have a boolean column `checkedIn` which can store whether the QR has been scanned. |
| Better error handling | As an example, currently if an `assert` fails, a `500: Internal Server Error` is received from the endpoint. With more time, I would want to implement better error messages to the users of the backend like `400: Bad Request` in this case. This would involve changing the return types of certain methods to indicate their success or failure, or using try-except blocks. |
| Testing | With more time, I would have liked to add testing using pytest. I would test all endpoints using sample data generated by pytest fixtures. I would test edge cases like NULL inputs. |

## Final Note

I sincerely hope that this challenge shows my interest in Hack the North. I firmly believe that I have the technical capability to bring value to the team. I would absolutely love to chat about my motivation to join the team and the experiences that have brought me here, and to discuss my implementation of the app. If you have questions about my app, or issues running it, please let me know! Looking forward to potentially interviewing and eventually joining the HTN team!
